				<h2>WELCOME!</h2>
				<p><br>So, you want to learn how to play Street Fighter 6, but you have no idea where to start? Well, you've come to the right place! Whether you are new to Street Fighter or to fighting games as a whole, this website will serve as a good starting point for you. And even if you aren't entirely new to the genre, stick around and browse. Who knows, there might be something useful for you, too.</p>
				<p><br>Now, let me begin by saying this: I am NOT a professional player. Like most other players, I am just a regular person who loves fighting games, and I've been playing them for pretty much most of my life. As such, I will try to keep this guide as simple as possible, like the name of this website suggests. Being a decent enough player &#40;at least, I like to think so :P&#41; I believe I am at a point where I think I'm capable of giving some advice to those who are new and help them improve. With all that being said, read on and embark on your journey to fighting game greatness!</p>

		<h2><br><br>WHAT IS STREET FIGHTER 6?</h2>
		<p><br>Released in 2023, Street Fighter 6 &#40;which I will refer to sometimes as SF6&#41; is a 2D fighting game developed and published by CAPCOM. Not counting re-releases and spinoffs, it is the sixth mainline entry in the Street Fighter series, and it is available on PS4, PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X/S. Like most of the games in this series, SF6 is similar in gameplay to the previous entries. At the same time, it has a bunch of mechanics and systems that are entirely new. Knowledge of common fighting game concepts like footsies and anti-airing still apply, while systems like the Drive Gauge introduce new things to the traditional Street Fighter formula.</p>
		<p><br>As of right now &#40;March 2025&#41;, Street Fighter 6 is in its second season of DLCs. Season 2, or Year 2 as it is called sometimes, comes with four DLC characters, two of which, Terry and Mai, have already been released. This means that by the time all of Year 2 DLCs are released, the game will have a total of 27 playable characters.</p>

		<h2><br><br>WHERE TO START?</h2>
		<p><br>While I will try to keep things simple, there is still a lot to cover. Use the navigation bar at the top to visit any section you wish to examine, but to start, I recommend you go through the Basics page first.</p>
