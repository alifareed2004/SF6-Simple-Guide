				<p><br>So, you want to learn how to play Street Fighter 6, but you have no idea where to start? Well, you've come to the right place! Whether you are new to Street Fighter or to fighting games as a whole, this website will serve as a good starting point for you. And even if you aren't entirely new to the genre, stick around and browse. Who knows, there might be something useful for you, too.</p>
				<p><br>Now, let me begin by saying this: I am NOT a professional player. Like most other players, I am just a regular person who loves fighting games, and I've been playing them for pretty much most of my life. As such, I will try to keep this guide as simple as possible, like the name of this website suggests. Being a decent enough player &#40;at least, I like to think so :P&#41; I believe I am at a point where I think I'm capable of giving some advice to those who are new and help them improve. With all that being said, read on and embark on your journey to fighting game greatness!</p>
